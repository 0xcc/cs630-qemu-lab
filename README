If you want to do the following exercise, PLEASE install qemu and some other
relative tools in Ubuntu/Linux system.

$ sudo apt-get install qemu

If want to do the exercise of CS630 in ubuntu with qemu, you need to execute
the following command to mirror the resources in the course site to res/:

$ make update

Usage:

1. "real mode" exercise

1) helloworld

$ ./configure src/helloworld.s
$ make
$ make boot

2) rtc

$ ./configure src/rtc.s
$ make
$ make boot

2. "protected mode" exercise

1) helloworld

$ ./configure src/pmhello.s
$ make
$ make pmboot

2) rtc

$ ./configure src/pmrtc.s
$ make
$ make pmboot

NOTE: In fact, some exercise not about "protected mode" also need to use the
2nd method to compile, for they begin execution with CS:IP = 1000:0002, and
need a "bootloader" to load them, or their SIZE are more than 512 bytes, can
not be put in the first 512bytes of the disk(MBR).
